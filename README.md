# 👾  PATRICK 📖    — Holographic Manifold Repair (study*)

> Redefining how we understand **time**, **gravity**, and **intelligence** with a mix of  
> quantum thinking, recursive systems, and slightly cursed code.

## 🧬 Who I Am

- Alias: **QRcode1337** / **Patrick**
- Stack: **TypeScript · Python · JS/TS backend · AI/LLM tooling · Three.js · multi-agent systems**
- Interests:  
  - Multi-agent AI in liminal / simulated spaces  
  - Neuromorphic & quantum-inspired architectures  
  - Narrative systems that blur the line between game, tool, and ritual  
  - Practical AI automation for real-world businesses (not just labs)  [oai_citation:0‡epsilon-pitch-deck.md](sediment://file_00000000914071fdb7fd35f26920818a)  

My world is split between **hard engineering**, **weird science**, and **applied AI** that actually pays someone’s bills.

## 🚧 What I’m Building Right Now

### 🛰 Epsilon — AI Automation for Small Businesses

Helping “offline” businesses stop leaking money via:

- Missed-call → instant SMS + lead capture
- AI-driven appointment scheduling & follow-ups  
- Review generation and reactivation campaigns  
- Free/low-friction website rebuilds to fix broken, expired, or non-existent sites  [oai_citation:1‡epsilon-email-sequences.md](sediment://file_000000003e5871fd938e53eb0f311cce)  

Think: **AI receptionist + growth engine** for auto shops, salons, barbers, and clinics.  [oai_citation:2‡epsilon-mockup-concepts.md](sediment://file_00000000553071fd84999a24ee00e4fd)

## 🧪 Selected Repos & Concepts

> Some of these are experiments, some are frameworks, all are part of the same long game.

- **`3dchess`** – 3D space chess in TypeScript  
  *Exploring higher-dimensional state spaces, but with pawns and queens.*

- **`hive-mind-backrooms`**  
  Multi-agent AI conversations in liminal “backrooms” environments.  
  Swarm orchestration, deliberation modes, behavior monitoring.

- **`liminal_backrooms` (fork)**  
  GUI for dynamic conversations between multiple AI models — a playground for emergent behavior and prompt-as-physics ideas.

- **`AI-Scientist` (fork)**  
  Working toward more automated, open-ended scientific discovery pipelines.

- **Epsilon tooling (private / in progress)**  
  - Scripts & flows for cold outreach, website teardown → mockup → deploy  
  - AI “Ops” patterns for SMBs (audit → implement → iterate)  [oai_citation:3‡epsilon-pitch-deck.md](sediment://file_00000000914071fdb7fd35f26920818a)

## 🧠 How I Think

- **Systems over hacks** – I care more about *repeatable pipelines* than clever one-offs.
- **Weird, but grounded** – Esoteric frameworks are useful if they help model reality or ship better tools.
- **Human in the loop** – AI as an amplifier, not a replacement. Especially in high-trust work.

Philosophically, I’m interested in:

- Recursive / holographic models of mind and reality  
- Intelligence as a byproduct of constraint navigation  
- Narrative and belief as “soft protocols” that shape hard systems  

---

## 📍 Current Focus

- Turning Epsilon into a **small, lethal AI ops engine** for local businesses
- Building better **multi-agent sandboxes** for emergent behavior
- Experimenting with **visual + spatial interfaces** (3D, liminal UIs, backrooms-style worlds)
- Mapping research from neuromorphic / quantum spaces into practical prototypes

---

## 🤝 Collaborations & Contact

I’m open to:

- Collaborating on **multi-agent frameworks**, **AI tools**, or **strange interfaces**
- Partnering on **AI automation** for small/medium businesses
- Contributing to projects that sit at the intersection of **science, art, and code**

> If it bends reality a little *and* helps real humans, I’m probably interested.
